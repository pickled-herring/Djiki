DJIKI PROJECT DESIGN

FIRST STAGE
	First stage is simple, perhaps the most simplest:

	Make a webapp with 2 sites: index & edit

	edit gives you a form that you can use to change the index content.
	That's it.  See templates and views and forms from django

SECOND STAGE

	There are several jobs that need doing before moving to the second
	stage. Firstly, You will need to start writing test, or at least learn
	how to write tests so we can be sure that our project is secure and
	robust and whatever. Secondly you need to start keeping track of the
	changes to the project. Create a git repository.

	Feature wise, I want to add change tracking. This might mean adding
	another python package.

	Secondly, We need to change the model. Currently, the only table in the
	database is the content table. If we're gonna keep track of changes we
	need to have a second table that stores the edits. Those edits have a
	foreign key pointing to the page that was changed, the change (a diff?
	a previous version?), the time of the edit and any notes about the
	edit. The content table itself needs to be updated. Each row represents
	a page and each page is going to need to have a title and the body text
	at least.

	I need to figure out how to format plain text into html too. This
	problem shouldn't be too hard since it's pretty detached from the whole
	system, but still.

	We're still on the pilot version of this software. I want to keep this
	as clean as possible. Or at least as professional as possible.

	in sum:
	For the orm:
		Content:
		  + Title
		  + body text
		  ? last edit

		Edits:
		  + Content object (foreign key)
		  + the change
		  + date
		  + notes
		  ? contact

	We'll work with 1 page first before creating entire wiki. We need
	multiple pages first if we're gonna work with auto link generation.
