SECOND STAGE DOCS

	The design file already has some specifications written out but I still
	need to consolidate what the design will look like and what the
	requirements will be.

    Models
	Content
	 + id
	 + title
	 + url
	 + body text
	 + last edit

    Interface
	djiki/?page-argument
	  jump to page, if it doesnt exist, 404
	djiki/edit/?page-argument
	  form to edit that page
	djiki/new/
	  form to create a new page
	djiki/submit-edit
	djiki/submit-new
	  pages to submit forms edit and new

    Testing
	Make sure the interface does what its supposed to, check return codes
	mainly.
